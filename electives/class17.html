        This is the space where we can all come together to focus on building a safe school community and working on service learning projects. This is a student-led elective, which means you work with the other students to plan activities, service projects, lessons, and create ways to make the school safe and inclusive. Last year students were planning to do a safe school assembly, made posters, and were finding ways to make the curriculum inclusive. Anyone can join this elective, even if you feel like you are not part of the LGBTQIA+ community, please come! Parents are not allowed in the classroom during this elective and myself, Ms. Bishop, and Mrs. Ruiz have worked really hard to make sure that no parent will know if you have signed up for this elective.
