    Do you have a love for Volleyball or want to try something new? Players of all levels will enjoy this fun elective.  We will begin with learning the basics like how to bump/pass, set, serve, block  and spike. Come listen to some music and play some ball. No experience required, just a passion for having fun and a drive to learn more about Volleyball as a sport! Who knows, If there is enough interest, we can organize some scrimmage games.
