    Music is such a powerful way to study history. In this elective, we use music to look at the Civil Rights Movement through the end of the Cold War (1990s) â€“ how people grappled with disinvestment, exploitation, racism, and sexism to build community and create innovative, joyful, and expressive music that impacted culture and liberation movements worldwide. We start with the emergence of hip hop and work backwards to touch on funk, soul, blues, country, folk, and jazz to explore themes of democracy, freedom, and capitalism. We will listen to music together and work on playlists to share by the end of the rotation.
