    Fire. One of nature’s most powerful forces. When not given proper respect, it is destructive and almost unstoppable. When it is treated with appropriate reverence, it’s also one of nature’s greatest tools. 
    
    Today, there are quite a few ways to cook our food. Electricity. Gas. Event compressed wood shavings (pellets). However, nothing matches the flavor of cooking over an open wood fire. 
    
    We won’t have time to do longer cooks - so we won’t be able to do ribs, brisket, pulled pork etc. We will explore some traditional grilling methods and see if we can improve on them. We’ll use what is considered the most universal grill, the kettle. 
    
    You’ll learn the basics of the kettle, how to start the fire and use the grill, and grill safety. You’ll learn about food safety. Finally, we’ll actually grill. This is an after-lunch elective, so do not count on having a lot to eat, but you will taste your results. We’ll explore different ways to add flavor, whether it be through rubs or sauces. Have a favorite recipe? Share it, hopefully we’ll be able to make it!
