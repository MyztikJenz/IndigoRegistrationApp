        Student newsletter is an optional two rotation class. In rotation two, students will have the time to write their contributions. I welcome students in rotation two who are also interested in creative writing, not just the newsletter. Mrs. Ruiz writes in her free time, has two published novels, and several published short stories. Sheâ€™s excited to read student work and help them develop the craft of storytelling.
