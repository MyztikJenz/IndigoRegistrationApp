    Students play a powerful role in making school a safe place for all.  Let’s face it, sometimes adults just don’t understand!  The conflict resolution team will be a place to learn how to facilitate the conflict resolution process to support your school community in resolving interpersonal conflicts in a way that promotes dignity and mutual respect.  You will have the opportunity to help students who ask for help and agree to bring an issue to the Conflict Resolution Team. Imagine supporting your little buddies in working out challenges they’re having with a classmate or supporting your peers who may not want to bring an issue to an adult.  In this elective, you will not only learn valuable conflict resolution skills, but you’ll have the opportunity to reflect with me and the rest of the team on issues and challenges that come up.  Who knows, you might even affect school policy!
