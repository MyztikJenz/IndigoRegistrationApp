        Do you feel pressure to figure out what you want to do in life? To find your passion? To know what to say for your 8th grade graduation presentation? Well, we’re not going to tell you. Instead, we’ll talk about how to get to know yourself, and how to open up to life’s possibilities. Ms. Mickie and Ms. Linda both have lots of experience in being wrong about what they wanted to do in life, and in figuring out their strengths along the way.
