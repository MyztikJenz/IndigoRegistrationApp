        Calling all content creators! Yearbooks are more than just a book of pictures. They capture memories in a way nothing else can. Come hang out with your friends while we create the 2023-2024 yearbook from the ground up. YOU design the pages, YOU take the pictures, YOU conduct interviews and get quotes, YOU create the yearbook you want! We will be responsible for creating content for 50+  pages for the school community and middle school.
        <p>
        Due to this larger responsibility, Yearbook is an extended elective lasting <strong>two sessions</strong> (you will be automatically signed up next session) and is 90 minutes long.
