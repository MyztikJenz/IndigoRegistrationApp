        You have ideas, strong opinions, and a unique point of view. You have important and entertaining things to say and we want to provide a space for your content to be created and shared. Letâ€™s write, draw, take pictures, and tell some stories. Come hang out with your friends and collaborate in the creation of something NEW for middle school.
         
        You and your friends will lead this exploration of expressing creativity through written and visual arts. Our communication projects may include:
        written works like short essays, short stories, or feature articles
        visual storytelling works like comic strips, photo journalism, or other illustration arts.
         
        Our studies and projects will depend upon you, your interests, and the creative vision you share. Join us in this exciting opportunity of building a creative showcase for publishing (sharing) into our middle school and possibly our school wide community.
