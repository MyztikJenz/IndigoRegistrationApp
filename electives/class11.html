        Help make the 20th addition of the Indigo Yearbook something to remember. YOU help pick the theme, YOU design the pages, YOU create the yearbook YOU want!  We’ll learn photography with our NEW professional camera, graphic design basics, some journalism and get to experience all Indigo has to offer to incorporate it into the best yearbook yet! Don’t forget our publishing pizza party at the end of the year!
