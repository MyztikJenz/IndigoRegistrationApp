        Are you ready for some flag football?  In this sports skills elective, we will start each class session by covering a fundamental football skill such as passing, catching, or kicking followed by 30 minutes of scrimmaging.  We will be playing on the grass field.  If you want to learn how to play, or you already know how to play and want some extra practice, join our fun Flag Football elective!
