        Are you competitive, like 🍿 🍪 🍬 🍓 or looking for something low-key? This elective may be for YOU! We will play games like Heads Up, Trouble, 🎶 🪑  and even compete in some TikTok challenges. If that doesn’t sound like fun, then how about grubbing on some of your favorite snacks 😋?  Still not sold, maybe gaming is not your thing, we will have something for everyone. You can take 📸 of your friends in action or assist me with the games.
        I look forward to some fun competition and seeing some familiar faces 😝 🙏🏼.
