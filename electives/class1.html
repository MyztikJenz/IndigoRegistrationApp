        NO MUSIC EXPERIENCE REQUIRED.  AN INSTRUMENT WILL BE LOANED TO YOU.  

        Uke-ologists have proven that it is really hard to have a bad day while you are playing an ukulele.  Anyone can play - you don't need to read music, don't need any experience playing music, and don't even need to own an ukulele - the school has instruments you can borrow while you are in this enrichment.    
        
        Come strum with me and discover for yourself how much fun it is!
