    Generative AI is a fancy term for ‘the computer can think and do things for itself’ (not really, computers are dumb). We’re going to learn about what GAI is, why it is dumb, but how you can use it to create cartoony or realistic images from text you write. Use these images for projects like these: 
* Make custom items like bookmarks, backpack decorations, and cards.
* Design AI-generated images for a themed room.
* Design AI-generated images for a line of toy products for pets.

…and accidentally make images of 2-headed giraffes and tables without legs….
