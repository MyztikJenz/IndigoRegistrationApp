        Maybe you’ve thought, “My day has been soooo …. hilarious, amazing, unbelievable, or even completely ordinary, I’m like a comic book character!”(No? Never. Really? Just me? Hmmm.) In this class, we will explore wordless books, comic strips, and graphic novels, then design comic strips or comic book pages using events and stories from our lives. We will look at work by Dan Santat, Nidhi Chanani, Gene Luen Yang, and Raina Telgemeier for mentorship and inspiration. We will totally be comic book characters!
