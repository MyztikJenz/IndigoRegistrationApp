        Ready to turn a fun idea into a real business? We’re going to start a slime business from the ground up! As part of the team, you’ll dive into every aspect of running a business—branding, marketing, finance, production, you name it! Each week, we’ll have team meetings to tackle new challenges and make our business better.

        By the end of the course, you’ll even get to create your own unique slime brand. Plus, all the slime we make will be sold to raise money for our Overnight Field Trip fund. If you’re excited about hands-on learning and seeing your ideas come to life, this elective is for you!
