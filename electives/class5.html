        Do you love math? Do you find it hard to come across challenging and non-boring math problems? Would you like to participate in a middle-school AMC 8 math contest? You will do some math puzzles, learn problem solving techniques, do a mock AMC 8 test run at school, and for anyone who is interested, prepare for the official AMC 8 contest, happening in January.
