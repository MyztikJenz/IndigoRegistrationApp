        The Dungeon Calls…
        You look to your left and see a snarling pack of goblins coming around the corner, brandishing crude spears and chattering excitedly to each other in their fiendish language. The other way is a dark corridor, extending seemingly forever and filled with a foreboding evil energy. Also it smells pretty badly like dragon. You are not excited to run into a dragon. Too many teeth… and claws… and fire.  Why couldn’t it be a shiny treasure trove instead?
        
        The goblins have spotted you!  Before you have a chance to explore other escape routes, you make the split-second decision to sprint away from the advancing foes and deeper down the dark, stony hallway.  A few thrown spears ricochet harmlessly off the walls as you run and the chattering soon grows more distant.  Now all you can see is darkness.  All you can hear is your feet pounding the floor stones.  Then you hear something else… the deep, resonating breaths of something waiting.  Something huge.  As you slide your trusty longsword from its sheath and prepare an attack spell, you wonder “will anyone back at the tavern believe this one?”
        
        Dungeons & Dragons is arguably the greatest collaborative storytelling game of all time, and the heart of it is imagination and teamwork.  Join us to create an adventure story that is literally unique, because you will be one of its main characters and can choose (with the Dungeon Master, other players and a few lucky dice rolls) what happens next.  
        
        Students will learn the basics of tabletop roleplaying and simplified Dungeons & Dragons rules to enable them to learn more complex games and even lead their own parties of adventurers outside of class.  Creativity required, but no other previous experience or equipment necessary.
