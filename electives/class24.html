        Interested in building Indigo and the community around you?  Together, we will pick a service project to do as a team that will improve the lives of a group in our community.  Improve campus life, lead year round philanthropy projects, and possibly partner with classrooms to create a service learning field trip.   Ideas: Care for Animals, Warm Blanket/Coat Drive, Social Justice, Teen Mental Health, Teach Kindness, Fight Poverty, Beautification of Campus.   Learning Objectives: Build compassion and service minded leaders.
