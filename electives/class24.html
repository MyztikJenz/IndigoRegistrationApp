        3D Art students will choose from among several construction mediums to complete an architectural sculpture.  Some options include cardboard tree houses, foam core open homes, and air dry clay rooms. Students will engage in a planning process to explore what they want to build, what materials will best suit their build, scaling, preparatory sketches and models, and will work with adults to problem solve as they construct their final sculpture.
