        Unleash your storytelling skills, collaborate with peers, and leave a lasting mark by crafting our school newsletter. Dive into the exciting world of journalism, where your voice matters and hard work pays off in every publication. Participants will design and write newsletters to share with the middle school. I am welcoming those who want to design the newsletter and those who want to only contribute.
