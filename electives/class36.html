        Some say there is science of happiness, an art to memory making, a freedom in being joyful. Others might tell you happiness is a choice, a habit, or a matter of perspective. In class we will explore some of those theories as we develop our journals. We will exercise our powers of observation, by noticing little things or small moments in our days and how we experience them. We’ll try out a variety of journaling techniques: photography, illustration, doodle notes, and writing. And through our work together, we’ll be growing our practices of appreciation, gratitude, and creativity.

        And don’t worry, if you are having a rough day, or few days even, you won’t have to <i>pretend</i> that anything is better than is – tough times are tough. We can be having a tough time and still notice the small moments that make us laugh or smile, the family or friends that help us feel comfortable, a song that we just <i>have to</i> sing along with or dance to. In class we will practice identifying and collecting our own joys, delights, and glimmers.
