        Note: This elective runs two sessions. You will be automatically enrolled next session if you choose this elective. This elective is also a double-rotation elective. It runs from 1:05 to 2:35.

        Students will engage in self-directed art activities and projects.  Students are expected to complete one food themed project that is art show ready (high quality, well thought out, completed one week before the art show).  For students who took Studio in Sessions 1 and 2, a second project needs to be completed for the art show but does not need to be related to the art show theme.
