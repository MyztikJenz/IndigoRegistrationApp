        Anatomy Lab! Woo hoo! You'll learn about the anatomy of an earthworm, cow's eye, and heart through study and dissection. It's as awesome as it sounds.

        AND! Now this class includes content for both beginners and re-takers. If you though earthworms innards were gross, wait until you get to disect frogs, crayfish, and squid!
