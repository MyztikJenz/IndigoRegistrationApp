        Do you ever feel anxiety about anything in life? Can you list ten things you are good or great at? Does taking on a huge project scare you out of your mind? Has fear of failing ever kept you from doing something important? Do you like yourself? Is making new friends easy for you or hard to do? Do you like having fun? Do you like Jolly Ranchers? 
        
        If you answered ,"yes", "no", "maybe", "sometimes", or ,"I don't know", to any of these questions then this elective is for YOU!!!
        
        This elective is all about you and supporting you to be the best version of you. It is about setting you up to win and surrounding yourself with friends who will hold you accountable to your dreams and help you realize them. It is about being a leader in your life and sharing your greatness with everyone. It is about continuing to discover who you are and the power you have to make wonderful things happen in your life. It is about taking everything you have learned at Indigo and putting it all to work for you. It is about making hard things easier for you. It is about making your life how you want it to be and having fun doing it. It is really all about you.
