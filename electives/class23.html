        Self-directed student projects and media exploration. Large scale projects or projects requiring specialized and/or expensive materials must be pre-approved by Ms. Tara. Drawing, painting, needle felting, mixed media, air dry clay, fibers/textiles, and cardboard are some of the mediums used by past students.  Digital media arts require use of school chromebook or use of a personal device that is permitted by parents/authorized adults for this purpose. Indigo and Ms. Tara assume no liability for loss or damage to personal digital devices.
