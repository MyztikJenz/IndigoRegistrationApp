        So many options here and students, as a group, will choose what projects they want to work on.  Will it be Art Show prop preparation? Graduation decoration? Creating a new coloring book? Crafting a quilt to raise funds for the school? Painting watercolor cards for hospitalized veterans? Sewing pocket hugs for foster youth? 

        Have an idea? Great! Join us and add your voice to our work.
