    Kickball 2.0 - Are you ready for a game that contains elements of Soccer, Softball, and most importantly Baseball - that's right folks, it's go time for Kickball 2.0!  We will focus on six drills that will make you the best kickballer on the block:  Kicking, catching, throwing, pitching, base running, and flexibility.  Once we have mastered these six skills we will have the ultimate Indigo kick ball series.
    
    Newcomb - For the second half of our elective, we will use two of our mastered skills from Kickball (catching and throwing) for Newcomb.  Newcomb is a game which introduces volleyball concepts, and at a higher level to work on positioning and transition. Just like volleyball, it's time to pass and score!
