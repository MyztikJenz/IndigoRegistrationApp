        Love reading? ME TOO, but… is not your average book club!! 
        During this elective, we will share books that we’ve loved and compile a list of book recommendations for fellow Middle Schoolers. Please come prepared with titles of books and favorite authors. We’ll talk about our favorites and find ways to share great books with our community.
