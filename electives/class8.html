        Not sure what to do with all your candy? Join us in making your own wood candy dispenser that is good for small candies like M&Ms, jelly beans, gumballs, or candy corn! We will prep materials, build the dispenser, and finish the project. We will be using basic tools such as drills, screwdrivers, saws, woodworking squares, and tape measures, etc. We will be sanding and painting our assembled project to your liking.  No experience necessary. Join us and learn how fun and satisfying it can be to build something with your own hands.
