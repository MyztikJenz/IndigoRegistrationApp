        Anatomy Lab! Woo hoo! You'll learn about the anatomy of an earthworm, cow's eye, and heart through study and dissection. It's as awesome as it sounds. 
        
        This class focuses content on beginners/first-timers of Anatomy Lab (later session may include more advanced content). If you thought earthworms innards were gross, wait until you get to dissect frogs, crayfish, and squid!
