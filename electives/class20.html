    What is light? Light is the one medium which unites all of human experience, from science to engineering to art. 
    We will examine light from a variety of angles. Through experiments we will look at the physics of light and the biology of seeing. We will see how light can be used to create beauty and art. We will examine how light can be created and what forms it can be made in. And we will discuss the environmental and social benefits and consequences of human made lighting.
    As much as possible, this elective will be hands-on and visual.
