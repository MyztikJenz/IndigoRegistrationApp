<div>Chess (Friday, R2 1:50-2:35)
<br> 
John Decker

<p>
    <pre>
    Come learn and then challenge your fellow students in one of the most popular games in the world, chess! All skill levels are welcome, from beginners to those that feel confident in their chess abilities  
        • We’ll discuss the origin of chess, which dates back hundreds of years (with some variations dating back to India almost 1,400 years ago!)
        • We’ll learn the moves allowed (and the strategies that come along with) each piece, from the straight-forward pawn, to the diagonally inclined bishop all the way to the all-powerful queen (the chess piece, not Queen Bey, although Beyoncé is powerful as well…although is Beyoncé too old for middle-schoolers now? If so, kind of depressing….)
        • We’ll pair off in the elective, allowing players of different skill sets to challenge one another
        • We’ll explore different variations, including speed chess, where a special timer is used to pass between each player such that you have only minutes of actual thinking time to try to best your opponent
        • Bottom line, come have fun with an amazing game that encourages strategy, forward-thinking, and a little bit of friendly competition

Students are expected to complete one food themed project that is art show ready (high quality, well thought out, completed one week before the art show).  For students who took Studio in Sessions 1 and 2, a second project needs to be completed for the art show but does not need to be related to the art show theme.

<p>
    <pre>
    Fire. One of nature’s most powerful forces. When not given proper respect, it is destructive and almost unstoppable. When it is treated with appropriate reverence, it’s also one of nature’s greatest tools. 
    
    Today, there are quite a few ways to cook our food. Electricity. Gas. Event compressed wood shavings (pellets). However, nothing matches the flavor of cooking over an open wood fire. 
    
    We won’t have time to do longer cooks - so we won’t be able to do ribs, brisket, pulled pork etc. We will explore some traditional grilling methods and see if we can improve on them. We’ll use what is considered the most universal grill, the kettle. 
    
    You’ll learn the basics of the kettle, how to start the fire and use the grill, and grill safety. You’ll learn about food safety. Finally, we’ll actually grill. This is an after-lunch elective, so do not count on having a lot to eat, but you will taste your results. We’ll explore different ways to add flavor, whether it be through rubs or sauces. Have a favorite recipe? Share it, hopefully we’ll be able to make it!

    Generative AI is a fancy term for ‘the computer can think and do things for itself’ (not really, computers are dumb). We’re going to learn about what GAI is, why it is dumb, but how you can use it to create cartoony or realistic images from text you write. Use these images for projects like these: 
* Make custom items like bookmarks, backpack decorations, and cards.
* Design AI-generated images for a themed room.
* Design AI-generated images for a line of toy products for pets.

…and accidentally make images of 2-headed giraffes and tables without legs….

    <pre>
        
        The Dungeon Calls…
        You look to your left and see a snarling pack of goblins coming around the corner, brandishing crude spears and chattering excitedly to each other in their fiendish language. The other way is a dark corridor, extending seemingly forever and filled with a foreboding evil energy. Also it smells pretty badly like dragon. You are not excited to run into a dragon. Too many teeth… and claws… and fire.  Why couldn’t it be a shiny treasure trove instead?
        
        The goblins have spotted you!  Before you have a chance to explore other escape routes, you make the split-second decision to sprint away from the advancing foes and deeper down the dark, stony hallway.  A few thrown spears ricochet harmlessly off the walls as you run and the chattering soon grows more distant.  Now all you can see is darkness.  All you can hear is your feet pounding the floor stones.  Then you hear something else… the deep, resonating breaths of something waiting.  Something huge.  As you slide your trusty longsword from its sheath and prepare an attack spell, you wonder “will anyone back at the tavern believe this one?”
        
        Dungeons & Dragons is arguably the greatest collaborative storytelling game of all time, and the heart of it is imagination and teamwork.  Join us to create an adventure story that is literally unique, because you will be one of its main characters and can choose (with the Dungeon Master, other players and a few lucky dice rolls) what happens next.  
        
        Students will learn the basics of tabletop roleplaying and simplified Dungeons & Dragons rules to enable them to learn more complex games and even lead their own parties of adventurers outside of class.  Creativity required, but no other previous experience or equipment necessary.

A journaling class (Monday, R2 1:50-2:35)
<br> 
Amy Sandler<br>
<p>
    <pre>
        Some say there is science of happiness, an art to memory making, a freedom in being joyful. Others might tell you happiness is a choice, a habit, or a matter of perspective. In class we will explore some of those theories as we develop our journals. We will exercise our powers of observation, by noticing little things or small moments in our days and how we experience them. We’ll try out a variety of journaling techniques: photography, illustration, doodle notes, and writing. And through our work together, we’ll be growing our practices of appreciation, gratitude, and creativity.

        And don’t worry, if you are having a rough day, or few days even, you won’t have to <i>pretend</i> that anything is better than is – tough times are tough. We can be having a tough time and still notice the small moments that make us laugh or smile, the family or friends that help us feel comfortable, a song that we just <i>have to</i> sing along with or dance to. In class we will practice identifying and collecting our own joys, delights, and glimmers.
