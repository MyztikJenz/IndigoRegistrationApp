        Interested in learning how to use a sewing machine? This elective will cover the fundamentals of beginning sewing. The first project will be a tote bag. Fabric and basic supplies will be provided but you are welcome to bring in your own fabric or sewing tools if you wish. We will go over the basic functions of a sewing machine and teach you how to use it. Additional projects will be discussed in class.  We hope you'll join us!
