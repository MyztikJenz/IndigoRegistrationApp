        Join me in the kitchen for dessert-making fun.
        We could make a cookie, a pie or a bun.
        
        Flour, sugar and butter make lots of good eats.
        There could be some ice cream or other sweet treats.
        
        We may make a muffin, a brownie or cake.
        I’m looking for students who really want to bake.
        
        I’ll teach you some lessons that seem a bit grand.
        I’ll teach baking science that you’ll understand.
        
        So, here’s the good news that I’m sharing today.
        The Baking Elective is now on its way!
