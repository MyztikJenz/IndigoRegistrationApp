        Flag football is like regular football’s chill cousin—no tackling, just straight-up speed and strategy. <strong>We strongly encourage co-ed flag football.</strong>  Check out some amazing girls who play (link below).  You rock those flags on your hips, and instead of getting crushed, you just gotta snatch a flag to stop the play. It’s all about quick moves, smart plays, and showing off your skills without the bruises. Perfect for anyone who’s all about that action but still wants to keep it light and fun!  We will celebrate the end of elective session with a “tournament” and snacks.
