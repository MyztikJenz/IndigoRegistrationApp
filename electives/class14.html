    You have an amazing opportunity as 6th-8th graders in that, you have an entire elementary school that looks up to you as leaders! 
    If you are interested in planning school events or becoming productive leaders in your community this is the elective for you! 
    Each 6-8 week session we will focus on one or two school events together. We will plan, create, and help execute fun activities that will enhance our school community. We will focus on respect, responsibility and service while connecting with our community in a positive way. 
    Activities/Events may include (but are not limited to): planning school dances, design spirit days, help with community events like: Harvest Festival, fun run, olympic day, Talent Show, Art, music show, Staff Appreciation, School Service Projects, Special Projects/Events etc. 
    We look forward to working with you on becoming strong, kind and productive leaders of your community!
