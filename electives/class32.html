    A few of the kindergarten and 1st grade enrichment parents are in need of an assistant.  If you enjoy working with younger students and would like to help Ms. Janice Son with origami or Ms. Martha Honda with hand sewing projects, please sign up.  The enrichments start at 12:45 but you would be able to arrive after your lunch time at 1:05pm in Ms. Loriâ€™s classroom. The enrichments will end at 1:35pm.  Ms. Lori may need you to help her with other class activities such as quiet reading, sitting with a child and helping them stay focused, or organizing materials until 1:50pm when your elective time is over.
