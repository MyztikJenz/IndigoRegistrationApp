        Learn to use a microscope to find out more about the world around you. How does a grain of salt or sugar look like? Can you see it dissolving in real time?  How does a cell of bakerâ€™s yeast look like? What about the mold on cheese? Do any microorganisms live in a local lake, ocean or a puddle? How are plant and animal cells different? Look at your own cells or, if you dare, plaque growing on your teeth. See how microscopes are used in forensic science. You will learn how to use a microscope, to prepare slides and to draw microscope sketches. You will find out about the basic structure of fungal, animal and plant cells.
