        Join Mrs. Ruiz and learn the art of storytelling. We will read stories by published authors and your classmates to learn how to create a tale that readers can’t put down! Mrs. Ruiz writes in her free time and has two published novels and several published short stories. She’s excited to read student stories and help them develop the craft of storytelling.
