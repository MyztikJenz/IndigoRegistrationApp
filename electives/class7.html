    Come learn and then challenge your fellow students in one of the most popular games in the world, chess! All skill levels are welcome, from beginners to those that feel confident in their chess abilities  
    · We’ll discuss the origin of chess, which dates back hundreds of years (with some variations dating back to India almost 1,400 years ago!)
    · We’ll learn the moves allowed (and the strategies that come along with) each piece, from the straight-forward pawn, to the diagonally inclined bishop all the way to the all-powerful queen (the chess piece, not Queen Bey, although Beyoncé is powerful as well…although is Beyoncé too old for middle-schoolers now? If so, kind of depressing….)
    · We’ll pair off in the elective, allowing players of different skill sets to challenge one another
    · We’ll explore different variations, including speed chess, where a special timer is used to pass between each player such that you have only minutes of actual thinking time to try to best your opponent
    · Bottom line, come have fun with an amazing game that encourages strategy, forward-thinking, and a little bit of friendly competition
